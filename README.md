## Overview:
We were tasked with creating a responsive web application that lets users browse podcasts
while having a detailed amount of information on the modal with previews that display all 
needed information.

## Technology used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Initial Thoughts:
I did not come into this project extremely confident as typically a project of this scale would 
be something that would be worked on for two to three works while we were instructed to complete it within one.
