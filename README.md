## Overview:
We were tasked with creating a responsive web application that lets users browse podcasts
while having a detailed amount of information on the modal with previews that display all 
needed information.

## Technology used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

---

## Initial Thoughts:
I did not come into this project extremely confident as typically a project of this scale would 
be something that would be worked on for two to three works while we were instructed to complete it within one 
which combined with the large amount of study material for the new topic of abstraction just made time management
a very large challenge.

## Struggles:
* Time Management - Having to learn an entirely new topic while actively working with the project at the same time proved to be extremely difficult
* Abstraction - Even after trying my hardest to understand the topic of abstraction I struggled implementing what I learnt into my actual work
* Creating the modal - Creating the modal usually is one of the easier parts of a project, but for reasons which I still don't understand no matter what I tried the modal never seemed to appear even after changing the event listners, the modal.js and the main.js nothing seemed to work.
